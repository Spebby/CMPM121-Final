This is the repository for the first 3 assignments for CMPM121 @ UCSC, Spring
'25. The instructions for the first few assignments can be found
[here](https://yawgmoth.github.io/CMPM121/assignments/infrastructure.html). This
repository was designed with Unity 6000 in mind, though it should work in the
majority of other modern Unity versions.
